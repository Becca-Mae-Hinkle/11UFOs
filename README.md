# UFOs Sightings - a Javascript Assignment

Using `Javascript` to build dynamic webpages and other customization tools that include `Bootstrap`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to learn how to take the data that is stored as a `JavaScript` array or list and create a table to organize the information that will visually adjust as "events" change (i.e. filtering). In order to react when an element is changed, we use `Javascript` functions to loop through the data to build the table and create a customized dashboard. The customizations include filters with event listeners that will record the information when an element has changed and develop an interactive webpage. Filters can be applied in many ways. In this exercise, we reviewed how to display default data in the table, listen for a button click or trigger the table to update based on the user's input with a select criteria. Finally, we use `HTML`, `Bootstrap` and `CSS` to read the `Javascript` code and create a webpage that is easy to view, includes filters, images, and a synopsis of the topic.

## Topic

Are we alone in this universe? UFO sightings have been an obsession among many for centuries. Are they real or some government conspiracy? We have been tasked to help **Dana** with building a webpage in which others can access information of reported sightings and see for themselves. This webpage should include:

* A description or summary of the topic 
* A table to display all of the information from the data source
* Search filters that will allow for visitors to update the table based on the search criteria they enter.    


## Results


You will notice that a **"Filter Search"** section has been added. 

You can filter by one or all of the search criteria shown. For example, if you search by **"Date"**, you will see that the table updated to show the reported sightings that was recorded for that date.

## Summary

I found several drawbacks:

* I don't believe it is user friendly to all ages. For someone who is used to doing this kind of work it is easy peasy. For let's say my mom, who is 70, she would have a hard time.The search field is case sensitive and most people her age would like to capitalize the city, state and country. Yes, there is an example shown but I don't think that would help 100 % of the time.

* There isn't a button to click or a line that tells you to click enter. I myself had to try a few times and I built the form.

* The data is limited and outdated since it is not linked to a "live" source.

Recommendations for further development:

With the following enhancements, it can greatly improve the user's experience.

* Add additional customizations, such as click-buttons, dropdown list, and/or auto-fill that can help "guide" the user and make the page more interactive.

* Add functionality to pull the data from a live source that includes current and archived data not limited to only the United States, but globally.

* Add a "Latest News" section that will highlight an article showing the most recent reported sighting.
